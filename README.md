# The-Goose-Game
This Python code implements the Goose Game with two players.
The game board consists of 63 numbered squares (from 1 to 63).
The square "6" is the bridge and the squares "5","9","14","18","23","27" are the gooses.
The function roll is an auxiliary function defined in order to simulate the the throwing of the dice.
The code is developed throught a cicle while and a cicle for. It stops when one of the players reaches "63" with the exact dice shooting.
